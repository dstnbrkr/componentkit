<p>Conceptually there is a seam between the rest of the application (imperative code that mutates state) and the top-level component (below which everything is functional and immutable).</p>

<p>This seam is managed by the <code>CKComponentLifecycleManager</code>.</p>

<p>```objc++
typedef CKComponent *(^CKComponentFactory)(id model, CKComponentState *state);</p>

<p>@interface CKComponentLifecycleManager</p>

<p>/**
 @param model The state of the outside world. Passed to the factory.
 @param componentFactory A block that generates a component.
 */
- (instancetype)initWithModel:(id)model
             componentFactory:(CKComponentFactory)componentFactory;</p>

<p>/**
 Call this when the the state of the outside world changes.
 This asynchronously recomputes the component with the new model, then mounts it.
 */
- (void)replaceModel:(id)newModel;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>(void)mountInView:(UIView *)view;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(void)unmount;</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>@end
```</p>

<p>This object also encapsulates the asynchronous computation of updated components on a background thread.</p>

<p>Note that React has a similar seam when integrating with external, non-reactive Javascript. It has an almost-identical API called <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-api.html#setprops"><code>replaceProps:</code></a> (our <code>replaceModel:</code>).</p>
