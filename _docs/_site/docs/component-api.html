<p>The base <code>CKComponent</code> class is quite simple. Leaving out a few methods, it looks like this:</p>

<p>```objc++
@interface CKComponent : UIResponder</p>

<p>/// Returns a new component.
+ (instancetype)newWithView:(CKComponentViewConfiguration)view
                       size:(CKComponentSize)size;</p>

<p>/// Returns a layout for the component and its children.
- (CKComponentLayout)layoutThatFits:(CKSizeRange)constrainedSize
                         parentSize:(CGSize)parentSize;</p>

<p>@end
```</p>

<p>Weâ€™ll get to these two methods in a moment. For now, note:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Components are totally immutable. For example, there is no <code>addSubcomponent:</code> method.</li>
  <li>Components can be created on any thread. This keeps all sizing and construction operations off the main thread.</li>
  <li>The Objective-C idiom <code>+newWith...</code> is used for instantiation instead of the more typical <code>+alloc/-initWith..</code>. This is mainly for brevity. Getting rid of noise is important to keep components code readable.</li>
</ul>
