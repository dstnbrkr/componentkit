    A <code>CKComponentHostingView</code> is not supposed to be used inside a table or a collection view. It is supposed to be used standalone.
  </p>
</div>

<p>So you’ve created a component and now need some way to render it on screen. If your use case involves using components inside a table view or collection view, you should be using <code>CKComponentTableViewDataSource</code> or <code>CKComponentCollectionViewDataSource</code>. However, there are some cases where you want to render a component standalone.<code>CKComponentHostingView</code> was built for this purpose.</p>

<h1 id="setting-the-model">Setting the model</h1>

<p><code>CKComponentHostingView</code> has a settable <code>model</code> property that can be used to set the model. This triggers a full synchronous update.</p>

<h1 id="size-range-provider">Size Range Provider</h1>

<p><code>CKComponentHostingView</code> requires a size range provider to be passed into the initializer. The size range provider is an object that responds to a single method (<code>-sizeRangeForBoundingSize:</code>) that calculates a constraining size for a given view bounding size. </p>

<p>Typically you’ll want to use <code>CKComponentFlexibleSizeRangeProvider</code>, a class that conforms to <code>CKComponentSizeRangeProviding</code> and implements a set of common sizing behaviors where none, either, or both dimensions (width and height) can be constrained to the view’s bounding dimensions.</p>

<h1 id="layout">Layout</h1>

<p>To determine an appropriate size for a component hosting view, call <code>-sizeThatFits:</code> with the constraining size.</p>

<p>If an internal state change in the component causes its size to be invalidated, <code>CKComponentHostingView</code> calls its delegate method <code>-componentHostingViewDidInvalidateSize:</code> in order to notify the owner of the view that it should resize the view (the view will <strong>not</strong> resize itself).</p>
