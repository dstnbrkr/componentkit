<p>Your <code>+new</code> method should not modify any global variables or global state. This could result in a component returning different results for the same parameters, which would be strange.</p>

<p>If you’re a functional programming nerd, you can think of <code>+new</code> as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">pure function</a> mapping from a set of input parameters to a component. (Pure functions have many benefits, which I won’t attempt to outline here.)</p>
