ComponentKit is a view framework for iOS that is heavily inspired by React. 

ComponentKit takes a takes a functional, declarative approach to building UI. It lets you focus on what your UI should look like, not the steps necessary to build it. It emphasizes a one-way data flow from _immutable models_ to _immutable components_ that describe how views should be configured and does the heavy-lifting of building a view hierarchy from this description.

The framework was built to power Facebook's News Feed and is now used throughout the Facebook app. We introduced ComponentKit at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/atscale2014">@Scale Conference</a> in September:
